# 🚶 Computer Journey

Lots of things have happened ever since I began my computer journey.
I have learned a lot and have experimented a lot and I am still doing that.

Since I am really bad at remembering things, I wanted to create some kind of document to keep track of what I have done up until now and where I currently stand.
I am not trying to write my own life story here, but I do want to mark down the important steps of my ongoing journey.
The goal is to keep this as a big list where each point corresponds to a milestone or something worth mentioning.

This list is a *WIP* and is going to keep evolving as I discover and learn new things.

## ⏳ Timeline

The purpose is to try and retrace my computer science journey. I will *try* to keep it small.

Timeline:
- Before 2013:
  - Love drawing manga and want to make a living as a manga artist
  - Participate in drawing contests and got a reasonable spot
  - Real computer noob though
  - Do not even know how to set a slideshow background on Windows
  - Do not know the art of Googling stuff
  - Playing Minecraft and started experimenting with its [Redstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_circuit)
  - Created my own forum website using a forum builder tool
- 2014:
  - Started going to high school
  - Joined the [weeb](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Weeb) club to discuss manga, anime and other japanese stuff
  - Heard about the computer club and decided to give it a try
  - Computer club only had four-five people but it was so fun, lots of things to learn
  - Stopped going to the weeb club and went to the computer club instead (still a big weeb to this day tho)
  - Became a tad better at Minecraft's Redstone through watching tutorials and experimenting *(Thank you [Aypierre](https://www.youtube.com/user/aypierre)!)*
  - Discovered command blocks in Minecraft. First time *"programming"*
  - Started feeling like a Minecraft [H4X0R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) and began making Youtube tutorials about how to use command blocks and redstone for mortals
  - Failed to make something work in one of the tutorial videos
  - Spent 10 minutes trying to fix it but did not succeed
  - Uploaded the full video with no edit on YT (just 10 minutes of me struggling and failing)
  - Stopped the tutorial series after this miserable failure
  - But still continued playing with command blocks and redstone
- 2015:
  - Started big command block projects and created many One Command Creations *(it was a big thing back in the old days)*
  - Discovered [AlgoBox](https://www.xm1math.net/algobox/) during a Maths class
  - First real experience with a programming language
  - Spent entire time just programming maths stuff on Algobox
  - Algobox was not enough to quench my thirst for knowledge
  - I needed ***MORE***
  - Ended up finding [free online courses](https://openclassrooms.com/) and started learning C and C++
  - At this point, I was using most of my free time just programming in C/C++
  - Thank you [Mathieu Nebra](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_Nebra)
- 2016:
  - Still playing Minecraft and doing even more stupid stuff with command blocks
  - Became decent at C and started learning HTML and CSS
  - First time hearing about cryptography in an advanced maths course
  - Ended up learning a lot about cryptography systems and pseudorandomness
  - Created own custom algorithm based on the [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
  - Algorithm used a random cipher making the message look different each time (despite same content and same key)
  - I felt like a true champ for implementing my own cryptography system *(timeskip: years later, I realized how bad it was)*
- 2017:
  - Started going to university to learn programming on a daily basis
  - Still doing nonsense on Minecraft
  - Started doing even more C
  - Used SFML to make the Ultimate Space shooter game for the school's game jam (huge success)
  - Started learning about PHP, JavaScript and JQuery
- 2018:
  - Started learning about C#
  - Dabbled with WPF and similar stuff
  - Game jam week arrived and my group and I tried to make a rogue like in Unity
  - We spent too much time on the room generation algorithm and could not make it work
  - In the end, the game was a failure *(BIG DISAPPOINTMENT)*
  - Started a recursive-only course and got very confused
  - Started learning about Java
  - Experimented with Symfony and Laravel
- 2019:
  - Did some image processing with Python and CV2 (basics of AI stuff) 
  - Did a full VBA internship and for some reason, ended up remaking Excel inside Excel (project was fun but VBA sucks)
  - Spent some time trying to fix the room generation algorithm from last year
  - In the end, the algorithm was working well 99% of the time
  - Started software engineering curriculum
  - First time using Linux, dual boot install of Ubuntu 18 and Windows 10
  - Did even more C programming
  - Implement various interesting algorithms in C (compression, allocators, etc.)
  - Started learning a lot about hardware (ARM assembly, Boolean algebra, logic gates, ALU...)
  - Realizes Linux is way better for programming than Windows
  - Briefly learned about Angular but dropped very quickly
- 2020:
  - Failed the hardware course
  - Spent entire summer holidays re-learning full hardware course from scratch
  - Had a lot of fun playing with hardware components
  - Used Minecraft's redstone to train hardware skills
  - Reached pick greatness after making my own simple CPU from scratch reusing all the previous components and gates I had built myself
  - Retook the hardware course exam, piece of cake after two months of grinding ARM assembly and hardware
  - Realized Linux is better than Windows even for casual stuff but gotta keep Windows for gaming
  - Started learning about Graph theory *(Dijkstra the GOAT)* and complexity classes (THE BIG O)
  - Started learning about Operations research and earned one milk medal for solving bonus problems (still wearing it to this day)
  - A lot of functional programming *(looking at you OCaml)*
  - Creating a compiler for a made-up language in OCaml
  - Feeling more confident using recursive-only programming
  - Create own custom shell from scratch (coded in C)
- 2021:
  - Discovered the best programming languages of all times: Brainfuck
  - Had fun creating a very basic Brainfuck compiler in C
  - Started learning about esotheric programming languages 
  - At this point, I am almost only using Linux but I still have Windows for gaming
  - Did an internship using Java Spring framework
  - Started learning Vue.js and used it to make my biggest project so far
  - Bought a Raspberry Pi at some point and started using it for nonsense (mainly Discord bots and other Node.JS scripts)
- 2022:
  - Reinstalled Linux on HDD for more storage but now it is slow
  - Still using Linux but the Windows OS is faster
  - Started using Vim for quick edits in the terminal (not my main code editor though)
  - Used JHipster for a big school project and glad I am not using it anymore
  - Learned a tiny bit about NixOS and got confused a lot, but would like to give it another chance someday
  - Learned more about security and realized home-made cryptography algorithm made in 2016 violates [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle)
  - In the end, this home-made cryptography algorithm made years ago was pretty bad and very easy to break *(what a shock!)*
  - Started caring about privacy after discovering [Privacy Tools](https://www.privacytools.io/)
  - Began to gradually switch to only using open-source and privacy-friendly software

  - First time installing a custom ROM onto my smartphone: GrapheneOS
  - Only using FLOSS apps on my main profile
  - Started using Vim and NeoVim as main code editor
  - Learned about [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) *(not the music composer)* and its place in the keyboard layout history through this awesome [zine](https://www.dvzine.org/)
  - Tried it for fun (it was hard but overall a much nicer typing experience)
  - Dropped it after just two-three days and came back to AZERTY (I will definitely try Dvorak again in the future)
  - Installed Pop!_OS on an old PC and realized it was faster than my current PC running Windows 10
  - At this point, my Windows frustration was nearing its peak
  - Bought a NAS + picked a backup strategy ([3-2-1 rule](https://www.seagate.com/blog/what-is-a-3-2-1-backup-strategy/))
  - Moved Ubuntu files to Windows and deleted the partition on my PC
  - Hesitated on what to do for a few weeks...
  - Fuck Windows, time to single boot Arch Linux (best decision of the year)
  - Installed it from Scratch by following the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and some Youtube tutorials
  - Using X.Org as display server and [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/) as window manager
  - Started learning EVEN MORE about Linux (window managers, graphical environments, distros, mounting drives, sound servers, etc.)
  - Finally got my dual monitor setup working after spending weeks trying things with my Nvidia card and finally decided to use it as my primary GPU (thank you [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus#Use_NVIDIA_graphics_only))
- 2024:
  - As this new year's biggest resolution, I decided to pick up Rust again and learn/experiment with it on a daily basis
  - Discovered the wonderful world of ergonomic keyboards and their open source firmware
  - Switched to QWERTY US layout after having used AZERTY all my life (some characters heavily used when programming are easier to input)
  - Started using the ergonomic [Sofle keyboard](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard)
