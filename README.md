## üêò `whoami`?

<div align="justify">
<p>At my core, I would say I am fundamentaly a <b>lazy</b> and <b>curious</b> person:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Lazy because I hate doing the same tedious tasks over and over when I could have an automated system do it in my stead.</li>
  <li>And curious because the world of computer science is both fascinating and very complex and I always want to learn more about it.</li>
</ul>
 <p>I am amazed by how humans were able to design such complex information systems in so little time. The more I learn about computers, the more I realize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">how little I know</a> about them.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning new things, this is what keeps me going in life.</p>
<p>If I had an infinite amount of time, I would love to learn about every seperate field of computer science. Whether that be how computers work down to the transistor level, how operating systems are made, what complex problems we have to solve to sustain a working world wide network, to the designing of websites, video games, AI and so on...</p>

<p>Up until now, I would say I have mainly worked with web development because that is the easiest way for me to share what I create with others.  Ultimately though, my love about IT is all about how we can leverage the power of computing to improve our daily lives.</p>
