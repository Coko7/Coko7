## üêò `whoami`?

<div align="justify">
  <p>At my core, I would say I am fundamentaly a <b>lazy</b> and <b>curious</b> person:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Lazy because I hate doing the same tedious tasks over and over when I could have an automated system do it in my stead.</li>
    <li>And curious because the world of computer science is both fascinating and very complex and I always want to learn more about it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am amazed by how humans were able to design such complex information systems in so little time. The more I learn about computers, the more I realize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">how little I know</a> about them.</p>

  ## üìö Learning is breathing
  <p>I enjoy learning new things, this is what keeps me going in life.</p>
  <p>While I have a preference for writing code, I love to learn about everything that has to do with computers and how they work.</p>
  <p>I have the most experience with web development because this has always been the easiest way for me to share what I create with others. That's why many of my projects are related to the web. Ultimately though, as long I find an idea, project or technology interesting, I will certainly have fun working with it.</p>
  <p>I once started learning about logic gates and how computers function at the hardware level. Despite being very different from casual programming and very far from web development, it was one of the learning experiences I enjoyed the most.</p>
  <p>Learning is my oxygen and if I do not learn something new every week I become bored very quickly and start feeling down.</p>

  ## üëÅÔ∏è Privacy focus
  <p>I am a privacy-focused guy and I like to be mindful of where my data goes. I spend a lot of time picking the tools and apps I want to use, and making sure they align with my values.</p>
  <p>I strongly support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement">Open-source-software movement</a> and apart from the few indie games I play, I rely primarly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FLOSS apps</a> for my daily usage.</p>
  <p>That lead me to be a strong Linux enjoyer and I prefer to stay away from Windows and Microsoft when I can. <i><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%20use%20arch%20btw">I use Arch btw.</a></i></p>
  <p>Linux also allows me to take full control of my system and tailor it to my way of working. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/Coko7/.dotfiles">.dotfiles</a> to get an idea of my current setup.</p>
