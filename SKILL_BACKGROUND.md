# üõ†Ô∏è Skill set background

I have spent a lot of time learning and experimenting with computers ever since I started to get into programming.
And because my brain can only store so much, I wanted to keep a list of all the things I have used either professionally or personnally during the years.
This list is a *WIP* and is going to keep evolving as I discover and learn new things.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Please keep in mind that this list is not an accurate representation of my current skill set.
It exists merely to list all the *artifacts* I have used during my life, which includes:
- Stuff I still use daily and feel very confident using
- Stuff I have tried out for a few days and eventually stopped using
- Stuff I have used a lot in the past but haven't used for a long time

Now you know.
I may update this list later to include the technologies I feel most proficient with but this is not the current aim of this list.

## ‚è≥ Timeline

The purpose is to try and retrace my computer science journey. I will *try* to keep it small.

Timeline:
- Before 2013:
  - Loves drawing manga and want to make a living as a manga artist 
  - Real computer noob
  - Does not even know how to set a slideshow background on Windows
  - Does not know the art of Googling stuff
  - Playing Minecraft and doing Redstone but not good at it
- 2014:
  - Started going to high school
  - Became a tad better at Redstone
  - Discovered command blocks in Minecraft. First time *"programming"*
  - Started feeling like a Minecraft H4X0R and began making Youtube tutorials about how to use command blocks and redstone for mortals
  - Failed to make something work in one of the tutorial videos
  - Spent 10 minutes trying to fix it but did not succeed
  - Did not edit the video and uploaded the full video with just me struggling to make something work
  - Stopped the tutorial series after this miserable failure
  - But still continued playing with command blocks and redstone
- 2015:
  - Continued playing Minecraft like crazy and still experimenting with command blocks
  - Started big command block projects and created many One Command Creations (it was a big thing back in the old days)
  - Started learning C and C++ as first programming language
  - Discovered AlgoBox
- 2016:
  - Still playing Minecraft and doing even more stupid stuff with command blocks
  - First time hearing about cryptography in advanced maths course
  - Learned a lot about cryptography and pseudorandomness
  - Created own custom algorithm based on the [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
  - Algorithm used a random cipher making the message look different each time (despite same content and same key)
- 2017:
  - Started going to programming university
  - Still doing nonsense on Minecraft
  - Started doing even more C
  - Used SFML to make the Ultimate Space shooter game for the school's game jam (huge success)
  - Learned about PHP
- 2018:
  - Started learning about C#
  - Dabbled with WPF and similar stuff
  - Started a recursive-only course and got very confused
  - Started learning about Java
  - Experimented with Symfony and Laravel
- 2019:
  - Did a full VBA internship (darkest memory) 
  - Started software engineering curriculum
  - First time using Linux, dual boot install of Ubuntu 18 and Windows 10
  - Did even more C programming
  - Implement various interesting algorithms in C (compression, allocators, etc.)
  - Started learning a lot about hardware (ARM assembly, Boolean algebra, logic gates, ALU...)
  - Realizes Linux is way better for programming than Windows
- 2020:
  - Failed the hardware course
  - Spent entire summer holidays re-learning full hardware course from scratch
  - Had a lot of fun playing with hardware components
  - Used Minecraft's redstone to train hardware skills
  - Reached pick greatness after making my own simple CPU from scratch reusing all the previous components and gates I had built myself
  - Retook the hardware course exam, much easier after two months of grinding ARM assembly and hardware
  - Realized Linux is better than Windows in more ways than programming but gotta keep Windows for gaming and some software
  - Started learning about Graph theory *(Dijkstra the GOAT)* and complexity classes (THE BIG O)
  - Started learning about Operations research and earned one milk medal for solving bonus problems (still wearing it to this day)
  - A lot of functional programming *(looking at you OCaml)*
  - Creating a compiler for a made-up language in OCaml
  - Feels more confident using recursive-only programming
  - Create own custom shell from scratch (coded in C)
- 2021:
  - Discovered the best programming languages of all times: Brainfuck
  - Had fun creating a very basic Brainfuck compiler in C
  - Started learning about esotheric programming languages 
  - At this point, I am almost only using Linux but I still have Windows for gaming
  - Bought a Raspberry Pi at some point and started using for nonsense
- 2022:
  - Reinstalled Linux on HDD for more storage but now it is slow, coming back to Windows because too lazy to re-reinstall
  - Started learning about privacy tools and such
  - Used JHipster for a big school project and glad I am not using it anymore
  - Learned a tiny bit about NixOS and got confused a lot, but would like to give it another chance someday
  - Learned more about security and realized home-made cryptography algorithm made in 2017 violates [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle)
  - In the end, this home-made cryptography algorithm made years ago was pretty bad and very easy to break *(what a surprise!)*
  - Stuck on Windows but using Linux daily via WSL
  - Started working as a full-time FullStack .NET developer
- 2023:
  - Installed and use GrapheneOS on Pixel phone
  - Started using Vim and NeoVim as main editor
  - Bought a NAS + elaborate back up policy ([3-2-1 rule](https://www.seagate.com/blog/what-is-a-3-2-1-backup-strategy/))
  - Fuck Windows, time to single boot Arch Linux
  - Started learning EVEN MORE about Linux (window managers, graphical environments, distros, etc.)

## üìù THE LIST (Forever a WIP)

Everything is here, *or will be...*
First, let's begin with a quick summary of the categories and how I will attempt to organize this maze:
- Web
  - Frameworks
  - Libraries
  - Tools
- Storage
  - Databases
  - Backups
- Operating systems
- ...
